### About
The Password Generator is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users create strong, secure passwords quickly and easily. It generates random passwords that meet security best practices by combining various character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. This tool aims to enhance security by providing passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, making it ideal for use in any online or offline application where password strength is essential.

### Key Features:
This password generator offers customizable options to suit individual user needs. Users can specify the desired length of the password, ranging from a few characters to longer, more complex passwords. Additionally, users can choose which types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to include in the generated password. The tool ensures that each password is unique and random, reducing the risk of common password attacks such as brute force or dictionary attacks. It also includes a user-friendly interface that allows anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to generate strong passwords with ease.

### Technologies Used:
The Password Generator is built using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript (ES6) for the core logic that drives password generation and user interactions. JavaScript handles the randomization and selection of characters based on user preferences. This ensures that every password is both secure and meets the specific requirements set by the user. The project also uses modern best practices in JavaScript to ensure that the application runs efficiently across all browsers and devices.

### How to Use:
To use the Password Generator, users simply specify their preferences (length, character types) and click the "Generate Password" button. The tool will instantly provide a new, secure password that can be copied and used in any application. The generated password is displayed in a clear and accessible format, allowing users to easily copy it for use. 

### Future Enhancements:
Future updates to this project could include features such as the ability to save generated passwords locally, an option to exclude certain characters from the password pool for specific use cases, or the integration of password strength meters to visually indicate how secure a password is as itâ€™s being generated. Another potential feature would be a password history section, allowing users to revisit previously generated passwords.
